# The HTML-first framework

Qwik offers the fastest possible page load times - regardless of the complexity of your website. Qwik is so fast because it allows fully interactive sites to load with almost no JavaScript and [pickup from where the server left off](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable/).

As users interact with the site, only the necessary parts of the site load on-demand. This [precision lazy-loading](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/progressive/) is what makes Qwik so quick.

## Getting Started

npm create qwik@latest
